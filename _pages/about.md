# üéì About Me

I am a fourth-year PhD Candidate in DEEP Lab at the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, supervised by [Prof. Xiao HUANG](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/index.html) and co-supervised by [Prof. Jiannong CAO](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/). Prior to that, I obtained my B.E. from [The Northwestern Polytechnical University](https://www.nwpu.edu.cn/).

My research interests include **Knowledge Graphs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation,** and **Large Language Models**, with the latest research presented at NeurIPS, ICML, KDD, ACL, WWW, TKDE, etc.. Currently, I am working on **GraphRAG and Long CoT Reasoning** for specialized domains.
