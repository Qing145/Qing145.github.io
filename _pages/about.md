# üéì About Me

I am a Postdoc with [Prof. Jiannong CAO](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csjcao/) (since 2024) at the Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I earned my Ph.D. from the same department under the supervision of [Prof. Xiao HUANG](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~xiaohuang/index.html) (2021‚Äì2024). Prior to that, I obtained my B.E. from Fudan University.

My research interests include **graph learning, reasoning**, and **Large Language Models**, with latest research presented at NeurIPS, ICML, TKDE, CIKM, etc.. Currently, I am working on **Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation for LLMs (graphRAG).**
